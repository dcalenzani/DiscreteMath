# Discrete Math in C++

I bought a big book called [Matematica discreta con apoyo de Software](https://www.escinf.una.ac.cr/discretas/), by Enrique Vilchez Quesada. The book uses the language Wolfram Mathematica for its examples and solutions, but I would personally cut my fingers off before touching a payed programming language that can only do math.

This repo is an effort to share some of the exercises in this book in C++. I think C/C++ are "basic" languages that could be used as rosetta stones for other languages, specially for Python. If you can build something on C++ you will probably be able to build it on python faster (but remember that Py is an interpreted language, not compiled).

## Some information on the book and others.

The topic of discrete mathematics is usually thaught in the latest stages of the Math undergrad, however the subjects of discrete math are so different from the ones in continous math that the basics of discrete mathematic knowledge can be grasped early in the career with the correct curriculum [The Math Sorcerer, more concrete citation needed](https://www.youtube.com/@TheMathSorcerer).

[Kolman, Busby and Ross](https://www.pearson.com/store/en-us/pearsonplus/p/9780137538782.html) state that the fundamentals for discrete math are to be found in sets and matrices, which in collection form mathematical structures. While not explicitly stated, discrete math seems to be the field of mathematics interest in the proof of whether an object (a number, set or matrix or even mathematical structure) is a part of another object. This could be one of the reasons why discrete maths have become so important for computer sciences and not so much for other sciences.

Enrique Vilchez book, in contrast with Kolman et al. doesn't bring much explanations around the definition of discrete math. This book is not written for freshman or sophomore year students Furthermore, its directly focused on the impact of the field in the software world, and constricted by the limits of the Wolfram Mathematica language. 

So, as I teach myself some C++ and discrete math, I'll try to provide my own interpretations of the book, and how can you "see" the math in your programs.
